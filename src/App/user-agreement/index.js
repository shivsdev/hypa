							This document provides a top level specification for Version 3.x

							be considered a very early draft and whilst its overall format
							attempts to cover the complete system, in reality only the

							This document is subject to continuous revision and will be

							It is important to realise that in places this document provides
							detail on components and component functionality beyond the
							initial V3.0 release. This is provided in order that the reader
							can better understand the context of the V3.0 components and their
							role in the larger system and thus can be considered during the
							detailed design and implementation stage of v3.0. In this manner
							the larger development should be more efficient and code rewrite
							reduced. In some cases this will extend to features being included
							in the accompanying flowcharts that are not explicitly required in
							V3.0 but can then be incorporated as code stubs in readiness for
							following versions.

							The terminology used in this document aims to provide a clear
							understanding of the intended software functionality to a
							technically orientated audience. As such much of the language and
							terminology used throughout is of a technical nature and many of
							the names and labels adopted here bear at least some relationship
							to those used in the world of Systems and programming Language
							design. However, in regard to any interpretation of this
							specification for the purposes of producing a final UI for product
							and the associated user’s documentation it is intended that naming
							convention and terminology be thoroughly reviewed and revised in
							order that it may be as clear and intuitive to the intended non
							programming user audience as possible.
