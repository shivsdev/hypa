								This document provides a top level specification for Version 3.x
								of the HypaIQ Software Suit. This version of the document should
								be considered a very early draft and whilst its overall format
								attempts to cover the complete system, in reality only the
								sections covering the core Form builder, together with the
								underlying scripting language contain any real level of detail.
								This document is subject to continuous revision and will be
								updated as the system design evolves.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is important to realise that in places this document provides
								detail on components and component functionality beyond the
								initial V3.0 release. This is provided in order that the reader
								can better understand the context of the V3.0 components and
								their role in the larger system and thus can be considered
								during the detailed design and implementation stage of v3.0. In
								this manner the larger development should be more efficient and
								code rewrite reduced. In some cases this will extend to features
								being included in the accompanying flowcharts that are not
								explicitly required in V3.0 but can then be incorporated as code
								stubs in readiness for following versions.
							</p>
							<p>
								The terminology used in this document aims to provide a clear
								understanding of the intended software functionality to a
								technically orientated audience. As such much of the language
								and terminology used throughout is of a technical nature and
								many of the names and labels adopted here bear at least some
								relationship to those used in the world of Systems and
								programming Language design. However, in regard to any
								interpretation of this specification for the purposes of
								producing a final UI for product and the associated user’s
								documentation it is intended that naming convention and
								terminology be thoroughly reviewed and revised in order that it
								may be as clear and intuitive to the intended non programming
								user audience as possible.
